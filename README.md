# Personal Assignment

This is an assignment given for the Web Services class I took in Spring 2023. In this assignment, we were to go out and learn about how to create our own Node project, add dependencies like nodemon, mongodb, and express, and use express' built in routes to send data to our page that we receive from mongodb. We are also expected to self teach by finding resources on the web. Most of what I have learned has come from external resources and I will be documenting it all.

### Creating a Node project with Express.js Nodemon Dotenv and MongoDb

- Create a node project by running `npm init -y`(the y answers yes to all the questions and quickly creates the project)
- Add express to your project by running `npm install --save express`
- Add dotenv to your project by running `npm install dotenv`
- Add mongodb to your project by running `npm install mongodb`
- If you will be testing a frontend with a backend you will need to run `npm install -dev cors` on your project and add a few lines of code to overwrite the cors policy
- You can shorten your install command by running `npm install express dotenv mongodb`
- Add nodemon for development purposes by running `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
- After adding dependencies, run `npm install` to create the package-lock.json fall
- Create a server.js file and make sure that your server.js file matches the name of `main` in your package.json file

### Serverjs

- The server.js file is the main file and its how we will call our routes and the functions contained within them.
- We start with a code block: `const express = require("express");
const app = express();` This is pretty basic and sets up the express application to require express.
- `app.use()` is how we connect our home route with the routes controller
- `app.listen()` returns what port we are listening to in the console

### Routes

- We create a routes variable that is how we will gain access to GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE routes. `const routes = require('express').Routers()`
- We then create a variable that connects to our controllers module
- Using the routes are as simple as calling functions like `routes.get()` with the correct page directory and the data we want to send
- We have to export the routes module at the end

### Controllers

- Controllers are a part of the MVC architecture(Model - View - Controllers)
- Our controllers handle requests from the Views by collecting data from the Model and returning it
- The controllers in our project will contain functions that make calls to the mongodb database and collection and return json data which we will then export to our routes

### Connect File

- Our connect file is what we wil be using to establish a connection with MongoDb
- We need to use a require statement to get MongoClient into our file for later use `const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");`
- We also require dotenv to use our mongodb URI found in our .env file `require("dotenv").config();`
- We save a variable containing our URI that we get using dotenv `const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;`
- Then we create a new MongoDb client and export it throughout our program for accessing the database `const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});`

### MongoDb Find()

- To find all documents in a collection we need to follow a few steps:
  1.  First, we need to make sure our function is asynchronous `async function getContacts(req, res) `
  2.  Make a connection to our database `await client.connect();`
  3.  Declare what database you are connecting to `const db = client.db("contacts");`
  4.  Declare what collection you are pulling documents from `const collection = db.collection("contacts");`
  5.  Call the find method on the collection and make sure to turn it into an array `const contacts = await collection.find().toArray();`
  6.  Send the data you received from the database through the res `res.status(200).send(contacts);`
  7.  Handle erors `catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).send("Error retrieving contacts");
}`

### MongoDb FindOne()

- Finding one document in a collection follows almost the same ideas as finding all with just a couple changes:
  1.  We need to require `ObjectId` from mongodb. ObjectIds are special autogenerated Ids for a document `const { ObjectId } = require("mongodb");`
  2.  In our asynchronous function we will be receiving an id from the route through the `req`. This id needs to be converted to a ObjectId. `const contactId = new ObjectId(req.params.id);`
  3.  Declare the database and collection as usual
  4.  Call the `findOne` method on our collection and pass the ObjectId as a query parameter `const contact = await collection.findOne({ _id: contactId });`
  5.  Send the data through our `res`
  6.  Handle any potential errors

### MongoDb InsertOne()

- Adding a single focument to the collection follows the same principles in previous sections but with a new function

### MongoDb ReplaceOne()

- This is our update in CRUD operations. In order to update a document we will need to:

### MongoDb DeleteOne()

- We need to be careful when deleted a document. To do so we will:

### Adding Documentation with Swagger

- We are going to need some public documentation for our API and a place to test our routes. For this, we will be using swagger.
- There are some real neat packages that we can use to do this quickly. These packages are [swagger-autogen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-autogen?activeTab=readme#usage-basic) and [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express)
- To install and utilize the packages we will:
